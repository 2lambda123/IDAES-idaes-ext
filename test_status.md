Testing status
==============

Currently, since the builds must be done off-line and uploaded to a release, the
test status does not necessarily reflect the status of the code currently in the
repository or any external repository.  This just shows the status of the most
recently tested builds.  This also does not show the status of the latest release.
Released binaries will have passed testing.
